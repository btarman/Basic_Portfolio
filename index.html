			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/bill_Tarman.jpg" alt="picture of Bill Tarman">

			<p>Hi! I am longtime veteran of the service industry and musician. I am just beginning down my path to becoming a full stack computer programmer. I have worked at Acme Food and Beverage for the last seven years as a senior server. It is casual fine dining and sources locally. A very high quality place to eat and has been a great place to work. I am very passionate about music and currently play in two local bands, SunnySlopes and Server. We're pretty rad so come check us out! I am expanding my coding knowledge daily and really love the challenge. I look forward to learning much more and starting in a new industry.</p>
